h1. Kineticwing IDE Plugins using Node Js

h2. Introduction

Kiwi-node-plugins allows us to write plugins in Node Js for KineticWing IDE. One can use any language to write plugins for KineticWing IDE using the flavours API. Here we are using Node Js for that purpose.

KiWiAPI.php contains API functions which lets us connect to the IDE and send requests. The requests are used to provide extended functionality to the IDE and control some of its functions.


We're using a "json-rpc":http://json-rpc.org/ based protocol for API and IDE communications. Its named 'flavours'.

So this is JSON-RPC based plugin system.

Each plugin loaded from Actions.Json. It creates menus and actions inside editor and register callbacks. For more check "Plugins Actions.json sample and explanation":https://github.com/speedovation/kiwi-node-plugins/blob/master/doc/plugins.textile

IDE will load all plugins here. Plugin manager is in progress.
